# hello-world
learning how to use github. 
I am Elijah Kioko, I was a student at Meru University taking a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology and I graduated with second class honors upper division.  I have worked as an intern for three months at TANATHI water services board in their ICT department and for one month at Makueni county government at an ICT center hence I have some experience in the ICT field.  I am currently working with Ellixar.com.

I believe success comes through hard work, passion, commitment, accountability, integrity, ability to articulate & execute short & long term plans and the ability to use effective communication to achieve results.
